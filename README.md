# frontendportfolio
module 2 challenge


In crafting my portfolio project, I focused on delivering a visually engaging experience using HTML and CSS. The initial load presents visitors with a nice interface featuring my name, a recent photo, and intuitive navigation links leading to sections about me, my work, and contact information. using CSS Flexbox, I designed the layout to ensure responsiveness across various screens and devices. Clicking on the navigation links triggers a smooth scroll to the corresponding sections, enhancing user experience. The "Work" section, cdesigned with Flexbox, showcases titled images of my applications, with one picture larger than the otherg Each application image is clickable. This project presents user-friendly portfolio that caters to the needs of potential hiring managers.
